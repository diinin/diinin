### Hi there I am Nasra ðŸ‘‹


I recently had the opportunity to finish the 16 week intensive bootcamp at the School of Code! During my time at the SoC, I had the oppurtunity to work with other bootcampers on a wide range of different workshops and projects. 
I worked in an agile manner, incorporating best coding practices and enhanced my soft skills to become a competent and highly motivated full stack software developer. 

Prior to attending the bootcamp I worked as a senior NHS pharmacist in a busy Trust within the West Midlands, where I was involved in the training and development of junior pharmacists.
